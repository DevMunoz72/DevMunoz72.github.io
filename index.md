## Favorite CPSC 120L Labs

* Lab 7, Part 1 

    This lab was one of my favorites because of the use of if statements. Before this lab I had watched videos on if statements and was very prepared for this lab. This lab is what finally made if statements “click” for me and fully understand them. All of that plus my partner and I were bouncing ideas back and fourth off of each other just made this lab very enjoyable and productive.

* Lab 6, Part 2 

    I enjoyed working on this lab because I am a fan of blackjack and to work on a lab that would calculate a player's hand in blackjack was really fun. Once again the program had us using if statements which I enjoyed. I also liked learning about using the AND operator as well as OR operators in this assignment. It was brief for this lab but it was a good way of introducing it to us.  

* Lab 5, Part 1 

    This one was interesting to me, but also very confusing at first when trying to find the area of the rectangle. Looking back on it, it was a good way to challenge us on using int, if statements, &&, and std::cin/cout. My partner was a big help on this lab and did a great job of explaining things to me and I felt like it was a very productive lab.
